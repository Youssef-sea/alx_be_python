# Define the variables
principal = 1000  # P (initial investment)
rate = 0.05       # R (annual interest rate as a decimal)
time = 3          # T (time in years)

# Calculate the simple interest
# Formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
